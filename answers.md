##Django answers
HyperlinkedModelSerializer works like ModelSerializer, but uses another way to represent relationships - it uses hyperlinks.
HyperlinkedModelSerializer helps for comfortable frontend usage (easy access to the related objects)

Within our project ModelSerializer looks better choice since it is simplier. HyperlinkedModelSerializer is better for more nested cases.

Database queries are still the most expensive part of the system. Caching makes it faster. When application makes big amount of requests to the database, system must ensure that the majority of them come from a cache. Amount of requests to the database should be as few as possible.

##Python answers
StartDateEndDateOrderChecker is validator to ensure that start_date doesn't come after end_date. This can lead to the wrong results. I would rather check it inside respective serializers for more readability and flexibility.

##SQL answers
Complex calculation is better to be done on the server side, since they are scalable here better. Computation on database side leads to grow of (significantly) rows and cols which makes database less flexible (SQL is not good language for computations). Communication between database and server is always time consuming and as much as possible calculations have to be done on the server side.

Interviewers and Candidates should be separated for scalability. For example, Interviewer can have more properties such as position,age, group. Timeslots tables are separeted for the same. Also, in future, with millions of rows, it will be faster. As alternative, in the current project, Interviewers and Candidates could be stored in the same table.

##Docker answers
Docker is engine to provide functions like Virtual Machine has.
Helps to deliver and run applications with different complexity.
Docker container keeps all dependencies inside and deploys application as one complete unit.  

Docker-compose is a tool to manage multi-container docker applications. Main file is docker-compose.yml with all params to run containers.

Docker swarm operates docker comands among a group of machines.
<i>A swarm is a group of machines that are running Docker and joined into a cluster. After that has happened, you continue to run the Docker commands youâ€™re used to, but now they are executed on a cluster by a swarm manager. The machines in a swarm can be physical or virtual. After joining a swarm, they are referred to as nodes. - https://docs.docker.com/get-started/part4/#prerequisites</i>

##Tests answers
Our app is too simple and made by one author.
Intergration testing more about moduled systems with different understandings and programmic logics.

More deep tests include:  
Different time formats, timezones (YYY-dd-mm)
Repeated timedates
Security testing like XSS, SQL injections
Name started with number
Email without @
Past dates
Start date and End date have different dates

##Code answers
This should not be a case. Perhaps for testing purposes.

##Cloud answers
Remote Dictionary Server - used to store data like {key - Value}.
NoRelation database. 
Mostly used for session cache and queues
